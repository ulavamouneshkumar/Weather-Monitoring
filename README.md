IOT Live Weather Station Monitoring Using NodemCU ESP8266
This post is all about IoT based Live Weather Station Monitoring Using NodemCU ESP8266. We will interface DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor, BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor, and FC37 Rain Sensor with NodeMCU ESP8266-12E Wifi Module. We will measure humidity, temperature, Barometric pressure, and rainfall and upload the data to a web server.we upload data in the thinkspeak cloud

Once the code is uploaded you can find the IP address of NodeMCU in the serial monitor. With the same IP, you can go to any web browser and display the data in a beautiful widget format. The project is very interesting and can be used in remote areas or in a freezer where the data is to be monitored.
